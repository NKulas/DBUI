# DBUI
Database user interface

This project is meant to make it easy to search and view data in a database. This started as a personal project to design a better application for viewing the inventory database at my workplace. I am now completely redesigning it to work with any database.

Note: It is not yet functional. I am hoping to have the first working version ready in the next few weeks.
