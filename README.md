# DBUI
Database user interface

<h2>Description</h2>
This project makes it easy to search and view data in a database.

I am currently working on transitioning from my original design of having "entity" and "property" objects to having objects that represent databases, columns, schemas, and tables. This current version is straddling in between the old and new desings, and as such the code is a bit messy. It will be getting better in future commits.

<h2>How to use</h2>
<ol>
<li>Enter the server name and appropriate credentials in the top left panel.</li>
<li>Use the dropdowns to select the database, schema, and table you want to use in the bottom left panel. Entering the information as text does not yet work.</li>
<li>Click "connect" to load the table data into the right panel.</li>
<li>Check the fields you want to search by and enter the value to search for.<li>
<li>Click "search".</li>
</ol>
